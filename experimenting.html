        <h2 style="background-color:#fff0ff;">>DAD'S ROLE IN MY LIFE</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Each and every person in this world has one person on whom they can rely on for anything</li>
            <li>My dad is one such person for me</li>
            <li>Ever since I was born, he has been my best friend</li>
            <li>He guides me in everything</li>
        </ul>

<p>There has  not been even a single day where he has not thought about us(Mom, my bother and me). My dad takes a lot of care to make sure we are healthy. If we  are sick, he stumbles and keeps worrying until we are fine again. Only in those times I have realized the true affection he has on us. Only a few people in our life help us so that we can lead a happy life. But a father is the only person who works hard for the goodness of the family.</p>
